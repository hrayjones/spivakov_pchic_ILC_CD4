# Comparing ABC interactions to CHiCAGO interactions

Lera wanted me to analyze the data to look for differences in the number of ABC interactions compared to CHiCAGO interactions. 

> Monday, July 18, 2022 at 8:17 AM: We decided to do a regression analysis on the gene expression vs peaks (b1 * Chicago + b2 *ABC). DO you recon you could generate a file like ~/miniPCHiC/hILCs/spivakov_pchic_ILC_CD4/data/peaks/RE/ILC3_RE.bed.gz, but such that we also see if and when the counts are coming from Chicago or ABC?

This analysis can only be done for the files with the ABC interactions included. These files are:

* CD4_1M_50K_5kb_within_newbmap_CHiCAGO_ABC_peakm.txt
* ILC_5kb_within_newbmap_CHiCAGO_ABC_peakm.txt

The ABC interactions were identified as any interactions that had an `ABC.score` > 0.
