# ATAC-seq

1) I obtained ILC3 ATAC-seq data from [GSE77299](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE130775) and CD4+ ATAC-seq data was gathered from [PRJNA380283](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5623106/).
2) The CD4+ ATAC-seq data was mapped to hg19 so UCSC liftover was used to convert the ATAC-seq data to hg38.
