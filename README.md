# Human Tonsil ILC3 pcHi-C Analysis with RNA-seq

___

## Overview

This repo will walk through the analysis of pcHi-C data generated by Mikhail Spivakov's group for Human Tonsil ILC3. We will also analyze Human Venous Blood CD4+ alpha/beta T-cells, in addition to the ILC3 data, as a positive control sample.

This data analysis uses the most recent files generated by Valerya Malysheva. The data includes ABC model interactions in addition to interactions generated by pcHi-C.

The analysis for each data type is describe below:

1. [`ChIP-seq Analysis`](docs/chipseq.md)
2. [`ATAC-seq Analysis`](docs/atacseq.md)
3. [`RNA-seq Analysis`](docs/rnaseq.md)
4. [`pcHi-C Analysis`](docs/pchic.md)
5. [`pcHi-C integrated with RNA-seq`](docs/expression_analysis.md)

## Directory Description

### `./notebooks`

The notebooks directory contains the jupyter notebooks used to perform the analysis. These notebooks are used interactively to generate the data.

### `./python`

The python notebook has all of the python code used to generate the feature files.

### `./r`

The `r` directory has the code for performing DESEQ2 analysis and plotting some data.
